2. Cell Cycle Checkpoints
3. mRNA Splicing
4. Translation
5. G2/M Checkpoints

## Biological Interpretation

### Neurobiological Implications
1. **Neurotransmitter Dynamics**: 
   - SLC6A9's significant expression suggests altered neurotransmitter transport, potentially impacting synaptic function.

2. **Cellular Stress and Protein Dynamics**:
   - Enrichment in RNA processing, translation, and stress granule pathways indicates potential proteostasis disruption in Alzheimer's.

3. **Cell Cycle and Checkpoint Regulation**:
   - Significant pathways related to cell cycle checkpoints might suggest neuronal cell cycle abnormalities or increased cellular stress.

### Limitations
- Many known Alzheimer's genes did not reach strict statistical significance
- Potential confounding factors like age were considered in the analysis
- Results suggest subtle, widespread transcriptional changes rather than dramatic alterations

## Recommendations for Further Research
1. Validate SLC6A9 and top differential genes in larger cohorts
2. Investigate functional consequences of observed gene expression changes
3. Explore interaction networks of identified genes
4. Consider multi-omics approaches to complement transcriptomic findings

## Conclusion
This analysis reveals complex transcriptional landscape changes in Alzheimer's disease, highlighting the multifaceted nature of the disease's molecular mechanisms.
